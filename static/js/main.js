    "Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” Lunsford and Connors 116. Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph. Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea.The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the paragraph. At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information to the larger paper, or you can make a concluding point for this example. You might, however, simply transition to the next paragraph.Imagine each paragraph as a sandwich. The real content of the sandwich the meat or other filling is in the middle. It includes all the evidence you need to make the point. But it gets kind of messy to eat a sandwich without any bread. Your readers don’t know what to do with all the evidence you’ve given them. So, the top slice of bread i.e the first sentence of the paragraph explains the topic or controlling idea of the paragraph. And, the bottom slice i.e the last sentence of the paragraph tells the reader how the paragraph relates to the broader argument. In the original and revised paragraphs below, notice how a topic sentence expressing the controlling idea tells the reader the point of all the evidence.",

    "The periodic table is one of the most fundamental tools in chemistry and science at large, representing a comprehensive and organized framework that categorizes all known chemical elements based on their properties and atomic structure. Developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in the 19th century, the table arranges elements in a grid where rows, known as periods, and columns, known as groups or families, reflect recurring trends and similarities among elements. Each element is listed with its atomic number, symbol, and atomic weight, providing a snapshot of its characteristics. The periodic table is divided into several blocks based on electron configurations, including the s-block, p-block, d-block, and f-block, which correspond to the element’s electron orbitals. These arrangements not only highlight the periodic law—where elements exhibit periodic properties when ordered by increasing atomic number—but also enable predictions about element behavior, chemical reactions, and bonding. The table is further organized into metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, and includes special categories like the lanthanides and actinides. Over time, as new elements have been discovered and synthesized, the periodic table has expanded, reflecting advances in atomic theory and scientific understanding. Its design is a testament to the elegance of scientific classification and remains a crucial reference for students, chemists, and researchers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions in the universe.",

    "A black hole is one of the most intriguing and enigmatic phenomena in astrophysics, characterized by its incredibly intense gravitational pull from which nothing, not even light, can escape. Formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles, black holes come in various sizes, from stellar black holes with masses a few times that of the Sun, to supermassive black holes, which reside at the centers of galaxies and can have masses millions to billions of times greater than the Sun. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon, beyond which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, making the black hole's interior effectively invisible. Despite their mysterious nature, black holes are detectable through their interactions with nearby matter and radiation; for instance, when a black hole pulls in surrounding gas and dust, this material forms an accretion disk that heats up and emits X-rays, which can be observed by telescopes. Additionally, black holes can influence their surroundings in profound ways, such as by affecting the orbits of nearby stars or contributing to the formation of powerful jets that extend far beyond their event horizons. The study of black holes challenges our understanding of fundamental physics, particularly regarding the intersection of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Theoretical concepts such as Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking, suggest that black holes can slowly evaporate over time by emitting radiation, leading to questions about their ultimate fate. Recent advancements in observational techniques, such as the Event Horizon Telescope's image of the shadow of a black hole in the galaxy M87, have provided unprecedented insights into these cosmic giants. Black holes remain at the forefront of scientific research, offering clues about the extreme conditions of space-time and the limits of our current theories of physics, making them a central focus of modern astrophysical studies and a profound element of the universe's grand design.",
